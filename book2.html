                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children – Julian, Dick, Anne, George and their dog Timmy. The vast majority of the stories take place in the children's school holidays. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure.During their adventures, the five explore Kirrin Island, where George shows them a shipwreck that belonged to her great-great-great-grandfather. The ship had been transporting gold when it was wrecked in a storm, but despite divers investigating the wreck, the gold was never found. Excited by this discovery, the children decide to investigate further. They find the captain’s cabin in the wreck, containing objects belonging to George’s ancestor, including an old box. The box proves difficult to open, so they throw it from the highest window of Kirrin Cottage. To their surprise, the box breaks open, revealing an old map of Kirrin Castle. The map contains the word “INGOTS,” which they later realize represents the location where the lost gold is buried. The children embark on a treasure hunt, determined to find the hidden gold themselves</p>
