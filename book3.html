                    <h2>Ikigai</h2>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong>Hector Gracia and Francesc Miralles</p>
                    <p><strong>Author Desription:</strong>Héctor García was born in Spain and worked at CERN in Switzerland before moving to Japan, his home for 18 years and counting. While in Tokyo when he is not writing his next book, he makes a living in the IT industry.

                        His popular blog led to his international bestseller A Geek in Japan and later on The Magic of Japan. He is the co-author of the bestselling Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life; translated to 70 languages. Ikigai has the strange honor of being the most translated book ever originally written in Spanish. To this day he has published ten books, the latest one translated to English is The Book of Ichigo Ichie, and recently he has published his first fiction work in Spanish.

                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>Ikigai can describe having a sense of purpose in life, as well as being motivated. According to a study by Michiko Kumano, feeling ikigai as described in Japanese usually means the feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment that follows when people pursue their passions. Activities that generate the feeling of ikigai are not forced on an individual; they are perceived as being spontaneous and undertaken willingly, and thus are personal and depend on a person's inner self.

                        According to psychologist Katsuya Inoue, ikigai is a concept consisting of two aspects: "sources or objects that bring value or meaning to life" and "a feeling that one's life has value or meaning because of the existence of its source or object". Inoue classifies ikigai into three directions – social ikigai, non-social ikigai, and anti-social ikigai – from a social perspective. Social ikigai refers to ikigai that are accepted by society through volunteer activities and circle activities. An asocial ikigai is an ikigai that is not directly related to society, such as faith or self-discipline. Anti-social ikigai refers to ikigai, which is the basic motivation for living through dark emotions, such as the desire to hate someone or something or to continue having a desire for revenge.</p>

                            <p>I liked the message of this book and the concept of ikigai, but I found the book focused more on longevity and how centenarians claim they were able to live so long. </p>
